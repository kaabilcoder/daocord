# DAOcord - The Decentralized Autonomous Communication Platform

## Description
DAOcord is a decentralized alternative to Discord, designed specifically for Web3 communities. It leverages the Orbis protocol to create a secure, transparent, and engaging platform for community interaction. With on-chain identity verification, token-gated access, and native rewards for active contributors, our platform fosters trust and incentivized engagement.

## Problem Statement
Current platforms like Discord are facing significant issues for Web3 communities, such as:
- Lack of robust security, leading to impersonation and phishing attacks.
- Difficulty in controlling channel access for token/NFT holders.
- Absence of on-chain reputation systems to validate user contributions.
- No native rewards for users who positively engage with the community.

## Proposed Solution
DAOcord solves these issues by:
- Implementing on-chain identity through Solana wallets, providing verifiable and secure community interactions.
- Introducing token/NFT-gated channels for exclusive access based on asset ownership.
- Building an on-chain reputation system to track user contributions and validate credibility.
- Offering native rewards (e.g., tokens or NFTs) to active community members who provide value through contributions.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solana (Orbis SDK)
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallets (Phantom/Solfare)

## Status
The project is currently in the ideation phase, and development will start soon. We are actively seeking collaborators and team members with Web3 development skills.
